# TypeScript + Node.js Project Boilerplate

Base project setup for a TypeScript library:

* TypeScript building from `/src/*.ts` to `/build/*.js`
* Output of types in `/build/*.d.ts`
* Testing setup with Jest and ts-jest (no need to compile before running the tests)

Just clone it and edit `package.json` to your liking.

Happy Hacking ðŸ›
